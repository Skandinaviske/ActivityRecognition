ActivityRecognition
====  
ActivityRecognition is an android application which can recognize uesr's activity. The user of our application could be able to:

* Our application starts with a greeting to the user with the current date and time. Then
immediately recognize the userâ€™s activity (walking, running, in vehicle or still).
* Whenever an activity is recognized, an appropriate picture (your choice) is displayed and text
describing the activity is displayed as well.
* Whenver the user is walking or running music from an MP3 is played.
* When the user is walking, display a map of your current location at the top of the screen.
* Create a local SQLite database to continuously store the start time of each activity along with
the activity type. E.g. (12:24, walking).
* Whenever a user switches to a new activity, a toast pops up displaying how long the last
activity lasted. For instance, if the user was walking and became still, a toast may pop up
announcing "You have just walked for 1 min, 36 seconds".
* when the user is walking or in vehicle show his/her continuous movement on the map.
