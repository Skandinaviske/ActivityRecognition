#ActivityRecognition
====  
ActivityRecognition is an android application which can recognize uesr's activity. The user of our application could be able to:

1. Our application starts with a greeting to the user with the current date and time. Then
immediately recognize the userâ€™s activity (walking, running, in vehicle or still).
2. Whenever an activity is recognized, an appropriate picture (your choice) is displayed and text
describing the activity is displayed as well.
3. Whenver the user is walking or running music from an MP3 is played.
4. When the user is walking, display a map of your current location at the top of the screen.
5. Create a local SQLite database to continuously store the start time of each activity along with
the activity type. E.g. (12:24, walking).
6. Whenever a user switches to a new activity, a toast pops up displaying how long the last
activity lasted. For instance, if the user was walking and became still, a toast may pop up
announcing "You have just walked for 1 min, 36 seconds".
7. when the user is walking or in vehicle show his/her continuous movement on the map.
